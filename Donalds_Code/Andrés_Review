# Review

Nice code and nice results! I actually learnt a few tricks here.

Just three suggestions:
* The code would benefit from a clean-up. There are various lines that are just commented and borrow clarity.
* The `cout` statements would benefit if you used `printf`.
* The log-scaled plots would also benefit if you added also that they are in log-scale haha.

I'll give you five starts ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
